# About us

Founded in China, Go Global is a woman-owned business in a world of linguists where the quality of work is of utmost importance. We are dedicated to providing translation and localization services in the fields of business, financial, marketing and legal. 


# Services& Professions

Legal: Legal translation was central to our translation services when we created our firm some 6 years ago. It is still very much our core business. The transposition of the common law concepts into civil law - and its reverse - is difficult. Our translators, often legal practitioners, are familiar with both legal systems. We are also familiar with proceedings in the International Court.

Business: For businesses that want to reach global markets or diverse shareholders, we provide a wide-range of translations from marketing tag lines to technical brochures, websites, tax documents, personnel policies, annual reports, bylaws, management reports, annual general meeting minutes or board resolutions. We only use translators whose native language is the target language. We use translators who reside in the target countries, are familiar with its culture and have excellent writing skills.

Financial: We provide translation services for many international companies and those listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. We strictly control the quality and timeliness, and provide quality services for the information disclosure of listed companies.

# Our team

We are a team of enthusiastic professionals that have a love for languages. There are no projects too small or too big to handle. With an experience of over 6 years, we have worked on all kinds of demanding and challenging projects and they have all been completed on time and successfully.
